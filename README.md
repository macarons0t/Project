## 1. Cloning NUSMoney Project to my own repository

### 1.1 Create a local copy of the git_clone.sh file

### 1.2 Copy the GitHub Repository
Create a copy of the Repository on your machine and push the cloned one to a new Repository. Follow the prompts in the Terminal closely. 


### 1.3 Double-check files in the directory
Ensured that a local copy of the cloned project is in the relevant project folder. Pulled the latest changes from my GitHub Repository into VS Code, with the README.md file updated.

## 2. GitHub Pages

From the Settings Tab, located the Pages Tab. Made the site live after changing the Branch to main and folder to root.
